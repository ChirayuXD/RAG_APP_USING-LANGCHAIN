Lucasfilm\\n\\nStyle and themes[edit]\\nFurther information: Hayao Miyazaki §\\xa0Themes\\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (November 2021)\\nStudio Ghibli films are mostly hand-drawn using rich watercolor and acrylic paints. The films use traditional methods of making animation where every frame is drawn and colored by hand. Computer animation techniques are used sparingly.[141] All the Studio Ghibli films use bright colors,[142][143] and have a \"whimsical and joyful aesthetic\".[144] Studio Ghibli’s art style tends to be more of a cozy European style that put a lot of undertones on the background and nature in the scene.[145]\\nThe films often focus on the lives of youth, especially school children. Common themes include the risks posed by progress to tradition,[146] environmentalism and the natural world,[146][144] independent female protagonists,[142] the cost of war, and youth.[143]', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli', 'start_index': 32718}), Document(page_content=\"Music[edit]\\nStudio Ghibli's music is almost exclusively composed by Joe Hisaishi, who has worked with Miyazaki on creating the music for his films for over 30 years. He uses storyboard images, provided by Miyazaki, to create an image album,[147] which is then used to build out the final soundtrack for the movie. The music has elements from Baroque counterpoint, jazz, and modal music[148] to create the unique sound that many associate with both Hisaishi and Studio Ghibli. Early on, the music in the films was known for its eclectic, synth sound, before later moving to more motivic and melody-driven music.[149] Especially present in earlier years, the music does not directly relate to the emotions and rhythms happening on screen.[149] Another defining feature is Hisaishi's unique use of leitmotif, rather than a singular song being associated with one character, the motif is the theme of the film.[150] Hisaishi began using leitmotif in Ghibli films first in Howl's Moving Castle.[149]\", metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli', 'start_index': 33715}), Document(page_content=\"Notable animators, background artists and character designers[edit]\\nMasashi Ando (Paranoia Agent and Paprika)\\nMakiko Futaki (Akira, Angel's Egg)\\nKatsuya Kondō (Kiki's Delivery Service, Howl's Moving Castle)\\nKitarō Kōsaka (Monster, Master Keaton, and Nasu)\\nKazuo Oga (The Night of Taneyamagahara, My Neighbor Totoro)\\nKenichi Yoshida (Overman King Gainer and Eureka Seven)\\nAkihiko Yamashita (Tide-Line Blue, Princess Nine, Strange Dawn, and Relic Armor Legacium)\\nHideaki Anno (Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Neon Genesis Evangelion)\\nTakashi Nakamura (Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Akira, Robot Carnival and Catnapped!)\\nAtsushi Takahashi (Spirited Away)\\nTakashi Watanabe (Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Slayers, Boogiepop Phantom and Shakugan no Shana)\\nHiromasa Yonebayashi (Arrietty,  When Marnie Was There)\\nSee also[edit]\\nAnime and manga portalCompanies portalStudio Ghibli portalTokyo portalAnimation portalJapan portal\\nGhibli Museum in Mitaka, Tokyo\\nGhibli Park in Nagakute, Aichi\", metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli', 'start_index': 34711}), Document(page_content='See also[edit]\\nAnime and manga portalCompanies portalStudio Ghibli portalTokyo portalAnimation portalJapan portal\\nGhibli Museum in Mitaka, Tokyo\\nGhibli Park in Nagakute, Aichi\\nStudio Kajino, a subsidiary of Studio Ghibli\\nYasuo Ōtsuka\\nStudio Ponoc, founded by former members of Studio Ghibli\\nList of Japanese animation studios\\nNotes[edit]', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli', 'start_index': 35533}), Document(page_content=\"^ Home video rights are held by Wild Bunch subsidiary Wild Side, with Warner Bros.
